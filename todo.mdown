### Version (0.0.2)

### Version (0.0.3)

* Header attributes should just be root attrs
* Handle translink atco-cif extensions during parsing
* handle bank holiday parsing
* Specs should not test the internal methods, should retrieve the objects to test from Atco.parse !!
* Remove data from the repo / gem
* If nil or blank data found. Remove from output
* Parse all objects into more native ruby objects
* "Models" are getting quite repetitive/declarative, declarative is good to allow for easy (understandable) mapping to better domain... however, use active model?
